# Simple CRUD Practice

This project is a simple CRUD application built for practicing basic operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It serves as a foundation for understanding how CRUD operations work in a web application.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (or any other database of your choice)
- **Package Manager:** npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Node.js and npm on your local machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```sh
    cd simple-crud-practice
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up the database:
   
   - If you are using MongoDB, make sure it is installed and running locally. Update the database connection URI in `config.js` file.
   
   - If you are using a different database, update the connection configuration accordingly.

5. Start the development server.

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
